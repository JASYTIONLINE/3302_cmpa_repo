# Admin Portal (ReadMe)
This ReadMe explains the why, what, and how of the Admin Portal.

---
## Why is this Admin Portal Here?
The primary function of the Admin Portal is to be a *Single Source of Truth* for policy, procedure, and standards specific to the administration of CMPA 3302.

 
## What Can You Find Here:
- This section will house any documents related to the administration of the CMPA 3302 Class.  
	- For example: the course syllabus is housed here

**NOTE:** Any TTU General information will be housed outside this KB

## How it works
 Documents specifically related to the administration of this CMPA 3302 course will be stored in this section. 
- For example:  
	- The course syllabus is house in this section
	- Any document or artifact relating to the administration of this class  will be housed off site and refenced here for easy access.

This system should allow me to be able to find all relevant guidance in one place whether its file size or content is stored here in the repo or not.
