# Workshop (ReadMe)
This ReadMe explains the why, what, and how of the Workshop Portal.

---
## Why is this Workshop here?
- The primary function of the workshop is to mange published supporting documents used to create the deliverables of CMPA 3302.
- This workspace also act as a temporary storage facility of unpublished works in progress (draft true). 
 
## What Can You Find Here:
- Each weeks assignments, their supporting documents, and intermediate drafts will be housed here for indexing and version control but will not be published to GH Pages. 

**NOTE:** When completed these deliverables will be submitted for grading and moved to the [[01-deliverables/index|Deliverables Storage Silo]] for archiving.

## How it works
 This Workshop is organized chronologically by **weekly work cycles**. There is a subfolder for each week of the course.
- For example:  
	- **Week 01 - houses all documents or proof of submission for week 1 on CMPA 3302
	- **Week 02 - houses all documents or proof of submission for week 2 on CMPA 3302
This keeps every assignment traceable through the full project lifecycle an gives proof of completion and time stamp incase of submission errors.
