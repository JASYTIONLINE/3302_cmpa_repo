- Deliverable (also known as Artifacts) are this course's medium for demonstrating the knowledge gained from the course material. The student uses the  [[02-knowledge-center/index|Knowledge Center Portal]] to house their own notes and reflections from course material to refence when creating the deliverables.
- The [[03-workshop/index|Workshop Home]] is where deliverables are manufactured. Inside the workshop is where you can finds the tools, Supporting documentation (artifacts created during the process but not submitted for grading), and works in progress (what will eventually become a deliverable.)
- The [[05-assets/index|Assets Storage Silo]] is where all the image, video, or audio files which are displayed online when the deliverable is rendered, but are not embedded in the document.  Instead the text uses HTML to reference the source file (Asset) without storing the data heavy file inside the deliverable.
