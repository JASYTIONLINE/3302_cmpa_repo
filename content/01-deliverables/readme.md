# Deliverables Storage Silo (ReadMe)
 This README explain the why and what and how of the Deliverables Storage Silo.  
 
---
## Why is this folder here?
The primary function of the deliverables folder is to act as a final archive for deliverables created and submitted throughout the course of CMPA 3302.  

## What Can You Find Here:
Here you will find either the final product (i.e. .md file) or proof (i.e. Screenshot of URL Submission) of the final gradable deliverables for the week.
## How it works
The Deliverables Storage Silo is organized chronologically by **weekly work cycles**. There is a subfolder for each week of the course. The sub categories are separated by each week from Week 1 though Week 8.

For example:  
- Week 01 - houses all documents or proof of submission for week 1 on CMPA 3302
- Week 02-houses all documents or proof of submission for week 2 on CMPA 3302

This keeps every assignment traceable through the full project lifecycle an gives proof of completion and time stamp incase of submission errors.
