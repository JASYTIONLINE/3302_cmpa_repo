[[i[readme|CMPA 3302 Knowledge Base Explained]]

This index page is the **navigational tool and portal into the CMPA 3302 knowledge base.** Its primary function is to serve as the entry point into the repository, allowing quick access to every **Delta Lane** and to the internal explanations on the

The **index page functions as:**
- **Navigation:** Provides quick-links into each Delta Lane (D0–D9) and to   the README.
- **Orientation:** Shows where to find the doctrinal explanations of each   lane.
- **Compliance Hub:** Ensures the repo structure aligns with DEIHC   standards.

The **purpose of this page** is to ensure that users of the repo can move seamlessly between the knowledge base structure and the explanatory doctrine that governs it. This page is both a **map** and a **guide**: it shows where everything is stored and explains how to use it.

## [[readme|What are Delta Lanes?]]

In this system, **Delta Lanes** are the structural categories that organize the repo. The term comes from the **DragonEye Industries Holdings Corporation DELTA System (D-System)**. Each Delta Lane corresponds to a functional area (D0–D9) that keeps work organized, auditable, and aligned
with standards.

In practical terms, these are the **“categories” the instructor required** for the CMPA 3302 knowledge base project. By calling them Delta Lanes, the repo frames them in a governance and project-management context while still fulfilling the assignment rubric.
