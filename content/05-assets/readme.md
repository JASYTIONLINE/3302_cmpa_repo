# Admin Portal (ReadMe)
This ReadMe explains the why, what, and how of the Admin Portal.

## Why is this Asset Storage Silo Here?
The primary function of the Asset Storage Silo is to be a storage single location for all assets used in the creation of any document published here on GH Pages or contained in this KB.

## What Can You Find Here:
- This section will house any assets called out in any supporting documents or deliverables relevant to CMNPA 3302.  
	- For example: image, video, or audio files included on pages and referenced through html source would be stored in this silo.

**NOTE:** Any File too big to be uploaded to GH will be stored off site and refenced via link on the document itself.

## How it works
 Documents stored on GH cannot hold embedded assets like video or images. the source document will call back to the image storage site here and be rendered on the published forward facing page
 
 This system allows files written in Markdown language and HTML to render the assets in a web browser without storing the actual file in the file itself.
