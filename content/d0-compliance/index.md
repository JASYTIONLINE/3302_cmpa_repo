# D0 Compliance Directorate Portal  

This index page is the **navigational entry point for the Compliance
Directorate.** 

Its primary function is to organize and provide access to all
repo-wide standards, policies, and compliance rules.  

This directorate serves as the **civilian equivalent of Command and
Control**: ensuring that all knowledge and deliverables within the repo are
created, labeled, stored, and assessed according to DEIHC, ISO, PMI, and
academic standards.
