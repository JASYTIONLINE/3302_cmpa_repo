# What is the D0 Compliance Directorate (ReadMe)

This README provides the doctrinal explanation of the **Compliance Directorate**. 

Where the index is the map, this page defines what this lane is for, how it works, and when it should be used.  Compliance is the **civilian equivalent of Command and Control (C2)** in the DELTA system. It ensures that the entire knowledge base functions under rules, standards, and validation procedures. Without compliance, the rest of the Delta Lanes cannot operate effectively.

## What is the Compliance directorate?

Compliance governs the **policies, procedures, standards, and audits**
that define how the repo is built, maintained, and validated. It is the
anchor of the system: the reason every document is labeled consistently,
standards are applied, and audits can prove compliance.

---
## How it works

Compliance organizes itself into four functional subfolders:  

- [[d0-compliance/policies/index|Policies]] → High-level rules for how the repo and
academic work must be governed.  
- [[d0-compliance/procedures/index|Procedures]] → Step-by-step instructions that
implement the policies.  
- [[d0-compliance/standards/index|Standards]] → Benchmarks and specifications (ISO,
PMI, DEIHC) that policies and procedures must meet.  
- [[audit/index|Audit & Logs]] → Evidence and verification that policies,
procedures, and standards were applied correctly.  

Together these ensure that all knowledge artifacts are not only produced
but also governed, validated, and trusted.

---
## When to employ it

Use D0–Compliance whenever you:  
- Create new policies or adapt existing ones.  
- Need step-by-step procedures to implement rules.  
- Must align work with external standards (ISO, PMI, DEIHC, rubrics).  
- Conduct audits or log verification events.  

---
## Similarities to Other Delta Lanes

- Like D1 (Personnel), Compliance defines **roles and responsibilities**.  
- Like D5 (Workflow), it captures **how things must be done**.  
- Like D8 (Monitoring & Control), it ensures the system is **measured and
validated**.  

---
## Distinctions from Other Delta Lanes

- D0 is **foundational**: it sets the rules for all other lanes.  
- Unlike D1 (which defines the student’s role), D0 defines the **repo’s
governing role**.  
- Unlike D5 (which explains workflows), D0 enforces **standards and
rules** those workflows must follow.  
- Unlike D8 (which checks performance), D0 ensures there are standards in
place to check against.  

Analogy: **D0 is the policy framework for the repo, while D8 is the
monitoring of whether compliance was achieved.**

---
## Purpose of D0 – Compliance

The purpose of D0 is to **anchor the entire system under governance**.  

It ensures that:  
- Deliverables are structured according to rubric and standards.  
- All knowledge is retrievable because metadata and file structures are
consistent.  
- An audit trail exists for accountability and quality assurance.  
- DEIHC, PMI, and ISO frameworks are satisfied.  

---
## Relationship to Other Delta Lanes

- **Feeds Into:** Every other Delta Lane (D1–D9) inherits rules from D0.  
- **Relies On:** D9 (Stakeholders) to identify authority figures who
enforce compliance.  
- **Parallel With:** D2 (Knowledge) — D0 defines **why and under what
standards** info must be managed, D2 defines **how info is stored**.
