# Monitor & Control Script Warehouse 

This folder contains the **automation scripts used in the Monitoring and Controlling phase of projects.** These scripts are practical tools that support the procedures defined in the D8 Delta Lane.  

Scripts in this directory are designed to:  
- Automate repetitive Monitoring & Controlling checks  
- Verify compliance with repo standards  
- Provide audit evidence that navigation and processes function as intended

## Purpose of Monitor & Control Scripts  

The **mc-scripts** folder exists to separate executable automation tools from supporting documents. While **support docs** (`[s]`) describe procedures in Markdown, the scripts here (`[sc]`) carry out those procedures in code.  

This ensures clear traceability:  
- **D8 README** defines the Monitoring & Controlling doctrine  
- **Support docs** (`s-…`) describe individual procedures  
- **Scripts** (`sc-…`) automate execution of those procedures
