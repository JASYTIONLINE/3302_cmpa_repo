# Monitoring & Controlling Script Warehouse

This ReadMe explains the idea and purpose of **Monitoring & Controlling (M&C) scripts** and why they are stored in their own folder within the D8 Monitoring & Controlling Delta Lane.

## What is a Monitoring & Controlling Script?

A Monitoring & Controlling script is an **automation tool designed to support the oversight functions of a project.** Its role is to perform checks, gather performance data, and confirm compliance with repo and project standards.  

For example, the closed-loop link check script verifies that navigation between the Home Index, a Delta Lane Index, and its README forms a complete cycle, ensuring that users can never get “stuck” in the knowledge base.

These scripts are the **execution layer** of the Monitoring & Controlling procedures. Where the **support documents** (`s-…`) describe the *steps* and *standards*, the scripts (`sc-…`) automate those
checks and provide audit evidence.

---

## How do they work?

- **Input:** They take the project plan, standards, or actual repository state as the baseline.  
- **Process:** They compare actual conditions against expected baselines (e.g., do the links work, do files follow naming rules).  
- **Output:** They produce reports, logs, or pass/fail messages that   show whether compliance was achieved.  

Every script in this folder is designed to answer a core Monitoring & Controlling question: *Is this project still aligned with its plan, standards, and requirements?*

---

## How are M&C scripts similar to other scripts?

- Like other automation scripts, they are **code tools** that reduce   manual work and enforce repeatability.  
- Like other compliance tools, they rely on **inputs, checks, and outputs**.  
- Like utility scripts (e.g., build scripts or data converters), automate repeated tasks

---

## How are M&C scripts distinctly different?

- **Purpose:** These scripts exist specifically to perform **control   and verification functions** tied to the D8 Delta Lane. They are not build tools, deployment tools, or data converters.  
- **Scope:** They automate the procedures described in Monitoring &   Controlling support documents (`s-…`), making them an extension of project governance.  
- **Traceability:** Each script is linked to a corresponding procedure and logged in audits, which is not always true for generic utility scripts.  
- **Placement:** Instead of being lumped into one large generic scripts folder, they live in the **`mc-scripts` folder under D8**, keeping their function clearly tied to the Monitoring & Controlling phase.  

---

## Why a dedicated folder?

The **mc-scripts** folder ensures that Monitoring & Controlling scripts are:  
- Easy to find when conducting audits or reviews.  
- Clearly separated from other types of automation (build, deployment, utility).  
- Directly linked to the Monitoring & Controlling processes defined in D8.  

This separation makes the repo more navigable and ensures compliance tools do not get lost in a cluttered scripts directory. It is obvious at a glance that these scripts belong to **project governance and compliance** rather than to execution or deployment.
