# CMPA 3302 Knowledge Base Explained

This readme explains the purpose of the **CMPA 3302 knowledge base** contained in the `contents` folder. where the CMPA 3302 Knowledge Base Portal is the map, this file defines **what this system is for, how it works, and how it should be used**. 

---
## What is the CMPA 3302 Knowledge Base?

The CMPA 3302 Knowledge Base is a **structured academic repository** organized using the **DEIHC delta system (d-system)**.  

the **D Lane System** adapts the military joint staff structure (J1–J9) and aligns it with PMBOK 6 process groups and PMBOK 7 performance domains to manage academic projects.  

---
## How it Works

- Each delta lane (D0–D8) represents a **functional area** of project and knowledge management.  
- The home [[index|CMPA 3302 Knowledge Base Portal]] provides quick links to all lanes.  
- Each lane has its own index (map) and readme (doctrine).  
- Closed-loop navigation ensures every page links back to home and its parent index.  

---
## When to Employ It

Use the CMPA 3302 knowledge base whenever you:  
- start an assignment or project.  
- need to find authoritative guidance on rules (D0), roles (D1), tools (D4, D6), or improvement (D7).  
- want to trace a deliverable across the PMI Project Lifecycle.  
- need to audit or validate work against standards.

## Purpose of the CMPA 3302 Knowledge Base

The purpose of this system is to create a **portal and operating model** for all CMPA 3302 work. it ensures that:   
- every deliverable is stored in the correct lane.  
- every process is documented and repeatable.  
- the repo remains linked to DEIHC parent systems as the single source of truth.
