# What is the D6 Systems Integration Portal(ReadMe)

This README explains the **Systems Integration Delta Lane**. Where the index is the map, this page defines **what this lane is for, how it works, and when it should be used**.

## What is Systems Integration?

D6–Systems Integration is the **technology interoperability lane** of the DELTA system. It defines **what systems we use (Obsidian, GitHub, Canvas, GPTs, scripts), how they work, when they should be used, and how they interrelate across the project lifecycle.**  

⚠️ Note: The **artifacts themselves** (scripts, prompts, guides) live in parent DEIHC repositories as the **single source of truth**. D6 links to them and explains how they should be used in the context of this repo.  

---

## How it Works

Systems Integration is organized into five functional areas:  

- [[d6-systems-integration/technical-guides/obsidian/index|Obsidian Guides (linked)]] → Guides for note-taking, linking, publishing, and plugins.  
- [[d6-systems-integration/technical-guides/github/index|GitHub Guides & Troubleshooting (linked)]] → Git commits, branching, sync, and common errors.
- [[canvas|Canvas & Support Integration (linked)]] → Submission workflows, support desk references,  integration into academic processes.  
- [[d6-systems-integration/automation-tools/index|Automation & Scripts (linked)]] → Scripts and prompt libraries that automate monitoring and control.  
- [[d6-systems-integration/integration-protocols/index|Integration Protocols (linked)]] → Decision matrices that define *when, why, who, and how* each system is applied.  

---

## When to Employ it

Use D6–Systems Integration when you:  
- Need instructions on how to use a tool (e.g., Obsidian plugins, GitHub branches).  
- Must troubleshoot a system issue (e.g., sync failure, Canvas error).  
- Decide which tool to use in a workflow (Obsidian vs. Canvas).  
- Need to explain who is responsible for using which tool in the project breakdown structure.  
- Validate how systems fit together across the lifecycle.

## Similarities to Other Delta Lanes

- Like D0 (Compliance), it defines **rules** — but for systems, not policies.  
- Like D4 (Sustainment), it provides **guides** — but focused on technology, not templates.  
- Like D8 (Monitoring & Control), it uses **automation scripts** — but here they are part of integration, not validation.  

---

## Distinctions from Other Delta Lanes

- **D2 – Knowledge:** Governs information architecture (blueprint); D6 governs technology systems (wiring diagram).  
- **D4 – Sustainment:** Provides reusable templates (road); D6 explains the systems (vehicles, drivers, and routes) and how they interact.  
- **D8 – Monitoring & Control:** Checks outcomes; D6 ensures the systems used to produce those outcomes are working together.  

Analogy: **D2 is the blueprint, D4 is the road, D6 is the users manual that shows how every system work within the stack.**

## Purpose of D6 – Systems Integration

The purpose of Systems Integration is to ensure the knowledge base is **technologically coherent and interconnected**.  

It guarantees that:  
- All systems (Obsidian, GitHub, Canvas, GPTs) are used correctly.  
- Users know when, why, and how to use each tool.  
- Integration protocols connect all tools into the larger project management lifecycle.  
- This repo always points back to the authoritative artifacts in parent DEIHC repositories.
