# D2 – Knowledge Center Portal  

This index page is the **navigational entry point for the D2–Knowledge
Delta Lane.** Its purpose is to capture and organize **information
management standards and guidance** for the CMPA 3302 knowledge base.  

D2 does not hold books, class notes, or assignments.
- those can be found in the [[d4-sustainment/index|D4 Sustainment Portal]] and the [D3–Workspace](../D3-Workspace/index). 
- Instead, D2 defines the **rules for managing information**: naming, labeling, filing, retention, and retrieval.
