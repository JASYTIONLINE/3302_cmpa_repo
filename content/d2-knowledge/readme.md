# D2 – Knowledge Center Explained (ReadMe)

This ReadMe explains the **Knowledge Delta Lane**. Where the index is the map, this page defines **what this lane is for, how it works, and when it should be used**.

## What is the D2 Knowledge Center?

D2–Knowledge is the **Information Management / KMS lane**. Its function is to define the **rules and systems for handling information** in the repo: how files are named, how folders are structured, how metadata is applied, and how information can be retrieved later.  

This lane does not contain the knowledge itself (notes, drafts, or deliverables) but instead **governs how knowledge is organized**.  

---

## How it works

D2 organizes its guidance into three functional areas:  

- [[d2-knowledge/naming-conventions/index|Naming Conventions]] → How to write file and folder names (lowercase, kebab-case, short codes).  
- [[Obsidian 1|Filing Standards]] → Where to place documents, how to cross-link them, and how retention rules apply.  
- [[d2-knowledge/retrieval/index|Retrieval]] → How to make information accessible through metadata, tags, and navigation paths.  
Together, these ensure that every document is **traceable, auditable, and retrievable according to DEIHC standards**.

---

## When to employ it

Use D2–Knowledge when you need to:  
- Create a new file or folder (to check naming rules).  
- Place a document in the repo (to follow filing standards).  
- Retrieve a past document (to rely on metadata and retrieval rules).

## Similarities to Other Delta Lanes

- Like D0 (Compliance), it enforces **rules** — but specifically about information handling.  
- Like D5 (Workflow), it defines **how** work should be done — but focused only on information management.  

---

## Distinctions from Other Delta Lanes

- **D0 – Compliance:** Defines *why* compliance is required; D2 defines *how information is managed*.  
- **D3 – Workspace:** Holds actual work products; D2 only defines *information management rules*.  
- **D7 – Learning:** Improves how the student works; D2 ensures that information products are always organized, regardless of learning method.  

Analogy: **D0 is policy, D2 is filing rules, D3 is the actual content.**

---

## Purpose of D2 – Knowledge

The purpose of D2 is to ensure that every document and artifact is:  
- **Named consistently** (metadata, kebab-case filenames).  
- **Filed properly** (correct folder, linked where needed).  
- **Retrievable** when needed (metadata + audit trail).  

Without D2, the knowledge base would collapse into chaos — documents would be misnamed, misplaced, and impossible to recover.
