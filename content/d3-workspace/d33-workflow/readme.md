# Workflow Explanations

This ReadMe explains the **Workflow Delta Lane**. Where the index is the map, this page defines **what this lane is for, how it works, and when it should be used**.

## What is Workflow?

Workflow defines the **academic operational rhythm** of this repo. It describes how each assignment is treated as a project, guided by PMI process groups (PMBOK 6) and aligned with performance domains (PMBOK 7).  

It provides the **step-by-step doctrine** that ensures assignments are planned, executed, controlled, and closed in a repeatable, auditable way.  

---

## How it works

Workflow organizes its content into three key areas:  

- [[process-groups/index|PMI Process Groups]] → Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring & Controlling, Closing.  
- [[performance-domains/index|PMBOK 7 Performance Domains]] → Eight domains that inform delivery and continuous alignment.  
- [[ceremonies/index|Ceremonies]] → Opening/closing ceremonies and rituals that establish rhythm and discipline.  

Assignments move through these groups in sequence, ensuring consistency week to week and project to project.

---

## When to Employ it

Use Workflow whenever you need to:  
- Plan how an assignment will flow across process groups.  
- Explain how PMBOK 7 domains apply to academic projects.  
- Document operational ceremonies (opening, closing).

## Similarities to Other Delta Lanes

- Like D0 (Compliance), it defines **rules of structure**.  
- Like D3 (Workspace), it is **execution-focused**.  
- Like D7 (Learning), it encourages **reflection and iteration**.  

---

## Distinctions from Other Delta Lanes

- **D0 – Compliance:** Provides governing rules; D5 explains *how work is rhythmically executed*.  
- **D3 – Workspace:** Holds the artifacts; D5 defines *the rhythm those artifacts follow*.  
- **D7 – Learning:** Captures lessons learned; D5 defines *how lessons are built into each cycle*.  

Analogy: **D0 is the constitution, D5 is the operating manual, D3 is the workbench.**

## Purpose of Workflow

The purpose of Workflow is to ensure every assignment is:  
- Treated as a project.  
- Organized by PMI process groups.  
- Aligned with PMBOK 7 domains.  
- Executed under a consistent academic operational rhythm.  

This lane provides the **repeatable structure** that makes projects predictable, auditable, and aligned with professional practice.
