# What is The D3 Workspace (ReadMe)

This README explains the **Workspace Lane**. Where the index is the map, this page defines **what this lane is for, how it works, and when it should be used**.

## What is Workspace?

D3 Workspace is the **execution lane** of the DELTA system. It is where
academic assignments and deliverables are developed week by week, broken
down into the five PMI process groups: Initiating, Planning, Executing,
Monitoring & Controlling, and Closing.  

If D0 sets the rules and D5 defines the rhythm, then D3 is **the desk
where the work gets done.**

---

## How it works

Workspace is organized chronologically by **weekly work cycles**. Each
week folder contains subfolders for the five PMI process groups.  

For example:  
- **Week 01/Initiating** → Business case documents.  
- **Week 01/Planning** → Outlines, resource allocations.  
- **Week 01/Executing** → Draft deliverables.  
- **Week 01/Monitoring & Controlling** → Logs, adjustments, status checks.  
- **Week 01/Closing** → Final deliverables and summary notes.  

This keeps every assignment traceable through the full project lifecycle.

## When to employ it

Use D3 Workspace whenever you:  
- Begin work on an assignment.  
- Need to organize outputs by week.  
- Must store artifacts in the correct process group for audit and grading.  

---

## Similarities to Other Delta Lanes

- Like D0 (Compliance), Workspace uses rules for structure.  
- Like D5 (Workflow), Workspace organizes activities in sequence.  
- Like D8 (Monitoring & Control), Workspace logs and tracks status.  

---

## Distinctions from Other Delta Lanes

- **D0  Compliance**: Defines the standards; D3 executes under them.  
- **D5  Workflow**: Explains the academic rhythm; D3 applies it in
practice.  
- **D8  Monitoring & Control**: Validates outcomes; D3 produces them.  

Analogy: D0 is the rulebook, D5 is the game plan, D3 is playing the game.

## Purpose of D3 – Workspace

The purpose of D3 is to provide a **structured workbench** for executing
assignments under PMI-aligned processes. It ensures that:  
- Every deliverable is traceable to its process group.  
- Work follows a repeatable rhythm across weeks.  
- Outputs can be audited and graded consistently.
