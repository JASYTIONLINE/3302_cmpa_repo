## What is D1 – Personnel?

D1–Personnel is the **self-management lane**. It is where the student
documents their role, schedule, and reflections on their academic
performance.  

This is where the student defines **what they do well and what they need
to improve**.  

---

## How it works

Personnel collects evidence and statements of self-management:  
- Roles = what I am responsible for.  
- Schedule = how I allocate time.  
- Reflections = how I see myself improving or struggling.  

It is not tied to a single assignment or project (that belongs in
D3–Workspace), but to the **ongoing academic context**.  

---

## When to employ it

Use D1–Personnel whenever you need to capture:  
- A high-level view of your responsibilities.  
- How you manage your academic time.  
- What you recognize as strengths or weaknesses.

## Similarities to D7 – Learning

- Both D1 and D7 are reflective in nature.  
- Both aim to capture *weaknesses and improvements*.  
- Both help drive continuous growth.

## Distinctions from D7 – Learning

- **D1 (Personnel):** Defines *what the current state is* → “what I do
well / what I need to improve.” It is like a **policy**: declarative and
high-level.  
- **D7 (Learning):** Holds the **tools and methods for improvement**. It
is like a **procedure**: prescriptive, process-driven, and experimental.  

Together, they form a feedback loop:  
- **D1 diagnoses** → **D7 prescribes** → results feed back into D1.
