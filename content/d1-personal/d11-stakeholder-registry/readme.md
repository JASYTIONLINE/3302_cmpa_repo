# D11 Stakeholder Registry (SHR) Explained
What is a Stakeholder Registry? The SHR helps streamline communication, avoid delays, and ensure support is available when needed — keeping the student on track and reducing friction throughout the term.
- In the academic world, a stakeholder register serves as a personal project management tool that helps students identify and track all the key individuals and groups who influence their academic success. 
- For a student, this includes instructors, teaching assistants, academic advisors, financial aid staff, technical support for platforms like Canvas, and even peers in group projects. 
- By creating and maintaining a simple stakeholder register, students can quickly access contact information, preferred communication methods, and the specific roles each stakeholder plays in their education.
