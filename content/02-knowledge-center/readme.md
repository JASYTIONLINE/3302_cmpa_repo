# Knowledge Center Portal (ReadMe)
This README explains  the why, what, and how of the Knowledge Center Portal.

---
## Why is this Knowledge Center here?
The primary function of the Knowledge Center is to house all the CMPA 3302 Specific Knowledge I have gathered throughout the course as a quick reference. The information contained in the Knowledge Center is directly related to enhancing my understanding of the course material, the subjects covered in the course, and the practical applications of the material in real life.  
##  What can you find here:
 The knowledge center will house things like the personal cliff notes from the reading and reflections on the course material.
## How does the Knowledge Center Work
The knowledge center is divided into sub categories based on the way the contes stored in each section are used.  
- For example: 
	- There is a section on Cliff Notes. This is where excerpts and  cliff notes from text books and other refences will be stored.  
	- Reflections contains my notes on the subject matter and my interpretations of how the subject matter apply to the course work and the real life applications being discusses.

This will be my primary source of refence when completing exercises, assignments, and projects.
