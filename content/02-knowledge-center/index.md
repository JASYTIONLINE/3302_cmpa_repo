# Knowledge Center Portal
This index page is the navigational entry point for the CMPA 3302 Knowledge Center.  This is where I keep all knowledge and research I have collected throughout the course. It contains material relevant only to CMPA 3302. 

**NOTE:** Refence materials and Resources relevant to TTU in general or applicable across multiple classes will be held in a higher level the TTU Knowledge Base but may be linked through this knowledge center for ease of access.
